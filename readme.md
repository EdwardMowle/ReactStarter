# Setting up the app

Install all required dev tools and dependencies with the node package manager.

```
npm install
```

Build the project by running webpack.

```
webpack
```

Serve the project using webpack-dev-server. For convenience a start script has been defined in the Node config (package.json) to do this.

```
npm start
```
